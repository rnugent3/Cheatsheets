This is my cheat sheet

ls
lists files and folers in a directory 

cd "____"
change directory to named folder

cd ~ 
change directory to home folder

cd ..
change directory to folder level one up 

pwd 
print working directory 

cat "___"
prints the stuff in a file

echo "___"
prints whatever you speak 

partial file name + tab 
completes the name of a file 

up arrow 
scrolls through previous commands 

> redirect 
directs one command into another, e.g. echo into make a file touch 

touch foo.txt
creates file named foo.txt
touch always creates plain text file

makedir folder1 
creates file folder named folder1

|
pipe command---take the output of one command, use as input for another 

wc
word count

w
word

c
characters 

so: wc -w counts words, wc -c counts characters (see explainshell.com)

_____ man 
gives any manual 

also for help: explainshell.com

rev 
reverses the order of whatever of that thing 

csv is plain text! can be manipulated from the command line. 

Okay so here is what I just did: 
cat nypl_items.csv | uniq > unique_library.txt
and that produced a new txt file with all the unique items in the csv file. Then I checked how many unique items are in the file to see if I did it correctly:
cat unique_library.txt | wc -l
and I found 99999 items. 

REGULAR EXPRESSION SEARCH STUFF
grep
this thing counts stuff, too
"globally search regular expression print"

file | grep -i "paris"
give all the LINES (hence -l) in the file that have paris (there are 191)
the -i flag makes the command ignore capitalization 
or add | wc -l 
and count them! 
61 entries have the word GAY!!!
